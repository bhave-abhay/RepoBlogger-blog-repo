If you're using a web browser to read this on a desktop / laptop computer, please do this. RIGHT NOW.

1. Go to the "developer tools" of the browser.
   - Most browsers have a shortcut defined with <kbd>F11</kbd> key
   - If <kbd>F11</kbd> does not work, look for the menu.
     - Here are some explanatory images:
       - Google Chrome
	   - Mozilla Firefox
	   - Apple Safari
	   - Microsoft Edge
     - If you are using some other web browser, please check their vendor's help document for how to access "Developer Tools" window.
	 - But do NOT even read ahead without opening the dev-tools window.
	 - I'm watching :eyes:

1. Locate the "Console" tab. You should see a <br /> **>_** <br /> carret waiting for your input.

1. Type `x = 10` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
   - This should cause an output **10** on next line. On last line, carret is waiting for your next command.

1. Type `y = 5` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
   - This should cause an output **5** on next line. On last line, carret is waiting for your next command.

1. Type `x * y` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
   - This should cause an output **50** on next line. BINGO....

 #### Congratulations, JavaScript programmer! :100: :smiley: :man_scientist_tone1:
 ------
 You just wrote a small program that multiplied 5 and 10!
 Just for the sake of fun, you can use any arbitrarily numbers and can use any of the arithmetic operators [Addition: +, Subtraction: -, Multiplication: \*, Division: /] to try for yourself.
